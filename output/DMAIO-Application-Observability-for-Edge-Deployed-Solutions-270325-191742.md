# Application Observability for Edge-Deployed Solutions

## Overview

### Background

### Pillars of Observability

The purpose of an observability system is to collect, process, and export signals. These signals typically encompass three main components:

- **Metrics**: Quantitative data that measures various aspects of a system's performance and health, such as CPU usage, memory consumption, request rates, and error rates.
- **Logs**: Detailed, timestamped records of events and actions that occur within a system, providing context and insights into the behavior and state of applications and infrastructure.
- **Traces**: End-to-end records of requests or transactions as they propagate through different services and components in a distributed system, helping to identify performance bottlenecks and dependencies.

For more information on these pillars and differences between metrics, traces, and logs, please refer to [Observability - Engineering Fundamentals Playbook](#).

## Edge Observability Design

In an edge system, the ability to send telemetry to the cloud for analysis requires 1) instrumented systems and 2) an agent that facilitates gathering and transmitting telemetry data to the cloud.

Azure Monitor is the umbrella term for a range of products that provide instrumentation, transportation, storage, alerting, and analysis capabilities.

## Data Sources

### Options Evaluated for Sending Telemetry Back to Cloud:

| **Data Source**                       | **Ease of Deployment**                                           | **Supported Environments**      | **Data Collection**                          | **Storage**                  |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Azure Monitor Container Insights      | Easy. Enabled as an extension.                                  | Supported in Azure only          | Automatically of predefined resources.        | Azure Monitor                |
| OpenTelemetry Collector               | Medium. Deployed using GitOps-based workflow. Requires YAML     | Multi-cloud, on-premise, hybrid. | More flexibility. Manual or automatic instrumentation. Vast array of open-source collectors available. | Multiple backends including Application Insights, New Relic, ElasticSearch, Prometheus, etc. |
| Azure Monitor Edge Pipeline (preview) | Not considered due to its preview status.                       | -                                | -                                             | -                            |

## Recommendation

### Assessment Criteria

1. It's crucial to account for periodic network interruption between edge systems and the cloud.
2. Bandwidth limitations: our solution should judiciously transmit telemetry to the cloud.
3. The system should offer workload visibility with minimal configuration.
4. The observability system should have the capability to enrich the telemetry for improved consolidation in Log Analytics and Grafana.

### Result

Based on the criteria, **OpenTelemetry** is recommended as the preferred technology.

## Data Platform

A data platform is used for aggregating, analyzing, and visualizing telemetry data to gain insights into system performance, health, and operational efficiency.

| **Description**         | **Metrics** | **Logs** | **Traces** |
|--------------------------|-------------|----------|------------|
| Existing dashboards      | Yes         | Yes      | Yes        |
| Sharing dashboards       | Yes         | No       | Yes        |
| Existing dashboards and data source integration | Out-of-the-box and public GitHub templates and reports. Limited to Azure Monitor. | Limited to Azure Monitor. | Can connect to various data sources including relational and timeseries databases. Grafana has popular plugins and dashboard templates for application performance monitoring (APM). |

## Proposed Development Plan

### Architecture

1. An OpenTelemetry Collector instance will be deployed per environment supporting software development lifecycle (SDLC).
2. Azure Monitor Agent (AMA) will be configured to pull telemetry from OpenTelemetry Collectorâ€™s Prometheus.
